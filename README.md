### Mini Challenge

What if we have a show with multiple associated dates?
```
$shows = [
     'Seinfeld' => ['July 5th, 1989 - May 14th, 1998'],
     'Curb Your Enthusiasm' => ['October 15th, 2000 - Current'],
     'The Simpsons' => ['December 17, 1989 - Current'],
     'Futurama' => ['March 28, 1999 - August 10, 2003', 'March 23, 2008 - September 4, 2013'],
];
```
Can we loop through this? Try it. Notice each value in `$shows` is an array now, instead of a string.
